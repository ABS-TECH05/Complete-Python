### Multithreading
## When to use Multi Threading
###I/O-bound tasks: Tasks that spend more time waiting for I/O operations (e.g., file operations, network requests).
###Concurrent execution: When you want to improve the throughput of your application by performing multiple operations concurrently.

import threading
import time

def print_numbers():
    for i in range(5):
        time.sleep(2)
        print(f'Number : {i}')
        
def print_letters():
    for letter in 'abcde':
        time.sleep(2)
        print(f'Letter : {letter}')
        
## create 2 threads
t1 = threading.Thread(target=print_numbers)
t2 = threading.Thread(target=print_letters)
t = time.time()

## start threads
t1.start()
t2.start()

## Wait for threads to complete
t1.join()
t2.join()
        
finished_time = time.time() - t
print(finished_time)
