Line 1: In the beginning, computers were simple machines designed only to perform calculations.
Line 2: Over time, these machines evolved into powerful systems capable of handling massive amounts of data.
Line 3: Software became the brain of the computer, telling the hardware exactly what to do.
Line 4: Programming languages were created so humans could communicate with machines more easily.
Line 5: Python became popular because it is simple, readable, and powerful.
Line 6: Files are one of the most important ways data is stored in a computer system.
Line 7: Text files are especially useful because they can be opened and read by many programs.
Line 8: When a file becomes very large, reading it all at once is not efficient.
Line 9: That is why generators are used to read one line at a time.
Line 10: This saves memory and makes programs run faster.

Line 11: Imagine a file that is several gigabytes in size.
Line 12: Loading it fully into memory could crash the system.
Line 13: A generator allows us to process such files safely.
Line 14: Each line is loaded, used, and then discarded.
Line 15: This is called lazy evaluation.
Line 16: Lazy evaluation is a powerful concept in computer science.
Line 17: It allows programs to handle infinite or very large sequences.
Line 18: Python supports lazy evaluation through generators.
Line 19: The yield keyword is what makes a function a generator.
Line 20: Every time yield is called, a value is returned without stopping the function.

Line 21: The function resumes from where it left off.
Line 22: This makes generators perfect for file reading.
Line 23: Large logs, data files, and reports can be processed easily.
Line 24: You can search, filter, and analyze text line by line.
Line 25: This technique is widely used in data science.
Line 26: It is also used in web servers and system tools.
Line 27: Memory efficiency is extremely important in real-world applications.
Line 28: Even a powerful computer has limited RAM.
Line 29: Smart programming avoids wasting memory.
Line 30: Generators help achieve that goal.

Line 31: A loop that reads a file line by line is very efficient.
Line 32: It works even if the file is extremely large.
Line 33: Python’s file object already works like an iterator.
Line 34: When combined with yield, it becomes even more flexible.
Line 35: This allows custom processing of each line.
Line 36: For example, you can clean data or extract specific words.
Line 37: This is common in text processing tasks.
Line 38: Search engines use similar techniques.
Line 39: They scan huge files containing millions of lines.
Line 40: Without generators, this would be impossible.

Line 41: Learning how to read large files is an important skill.
Line 42: It is often asked in interviews and exams.
Line 43: It shows that you understand memory management.
Line 44: It also shows that you know how generators work.
Line 45: Combining file handling and generators is powerful.
Line 46: Python makes this easy and clean.
Line 47: That is one reason Python is loved by developers.
Line 48: It lets you write simple code that does powerful things.
Line 49: Even beginners can handle advanced tasks.
Line 50: That is the beauty of Python.

Line 51: This text file is designed to be long and readable.
Line 52: It contains only normal characters.
Line 53: There are no strange symbols that could cause decoding errors.
Line 54: You can safely test your file reading program with it.
Line 55: Try printing only certain lines.
Line 56: Try counting the number of words.
Line 57: Try searching for specific keywords.
Line 58: All of this can be done using generators.
Line 59: Large file handling is a core topic in programming.
Line 60: Mastering it will make you a better developer.

Line 61: Software engineers often deal with log files.
Line 62: These logs can grow very large.
Line 63: Reading them line by line is the best approach.
Line 64: The same applies to CSV and text data.
Line 65: Python generators make this easy.
Line 66: They keep your programs fast and stable.
Line 67: You now understand why generators are important.
Line 68: You are not just learning syntax, you are learning how computers really work.
Line 69: This practical demonstrates real-world programming.
Line 70: You can now confidently read large files.

Line 71: Keep practicing.
Line 72: Keep experimenting.
Line 73: Programming becomes easier the more you do it.
Line 74: Understanding concepts like generators gives you power.
Line 75: Power to write efficient and scalable code.
Line 76: This is how professional developers think.
Line 77: They think about memory, speed, and efficiency.
Line 78: You are now learning the same mindset.
Line 79: That is what matters most.
Line 80: End of file.
